Workflow for predicting the hyperpolarizabilities of a vast set of molecules to screen the best candidates.
Welcome to DFT-Turbomole, a WaNo designed for predicting hyperpolarizabilities in molecules. Our workflow leverages Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using the Turbomole software suite. This WaNo enables efficient computation and screening of hyperpolarizabilities across a diverse range of molecular structures.
